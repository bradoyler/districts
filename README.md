## United States Districts

GeoJSON and other shape files for the federal legislative districts of the US.

Supported formats:

* GeoJSON
* KML
* Shapes for state legislative districts
* TopoJSON

## Using the shapes

All files in this repository are automatically published to [theunitedstates.io](http://theunitedstates.io), at predictable URLs.

For example, GeoJSON for New York's 1st district can be found at:

> [http://theunitedstates.io/districts/cds/2012/NY-1/shape.geojson](http://theunitedstates.io/districts/cds/2012/NY-1/shape.geojson)

The `2012` here refers to the year that these districts came into effect, and is the most current districts. "At Large" districts, where only 1 person represents an entire state or territory, are coded with a district number of `0` (e.g. `WY-0` and `PR-0`).

GeoJSON for the state of New York can be found at:

> [http://theunitedstates.io/districts/states/NY/shape.geojson](http://theunitedstates.io/districts/states/NY/shape.geojson)

Replace `.geojson` with `.kml` to get a KML version of a district.

You can also download [the entire set as a ZIP file](https://github.com/unitedstates/districts/archive/gh-pages.zip), and use them however you like. If you plan on using these for heavy traffic, or you want control over the domain name they live on, you should use this method.

We **cannot provide HTTPS permalinks** for these GeoJSON files, as [Github Pages does not support SSL](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156). If you want to use these files on your website and worry about showing your users mixed content warnings, you'll need to host them elsewhere. If this seems weird to you, [write Github support](mailto:support@github.com) to request SSL support for Github Pages.

### Crawling/discovering shape URLs
